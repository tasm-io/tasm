# Heuristic Evaluation

## Background

We just quickly performed this before user testing, so that we would have some questions to base our evaluation off of. It was not meant to be an in-depth review of our user interface. For our heuristic evaluation, we decided to use the "heuristic markup" technique. We used this because we didn't have the ability to hire "experts" for a small project like this.

## Initial Observations

- When I zoom in, there's lots of free space beside the device display. Why is it not centered?
- None of the speed settings are exactly what I want, why isn't there more choice?
- The text editor doesn't highlight my code. This would make it easier to read, and I would be able to spot invalid opcodes before I hit assemble.
- There's no way to change the font or the font size on the editor.
- There's no way to change the colour scheme to light mode, I usually prefer to use that.
- Why can't I have the keyboard and the display open at the same time.
- Pressing the buttons is slow. There should be keybindings to make it faster.

## Categorised Observations

### Visibility of System Status

- The text editor doesn't highlight my code. This would make it easier to read, and I would be able to spot invalid opcodes before I hit assemble.

### Flexibility and efficiency of use

- Why can't I have the keyboard and the display open at the same time.
- Pressing the buttons is slow. There should be keybindings to make it faster.
- None of the speed settings are exactly what I want, why isn't there more choice?

### Aesthetic and minimalist design

- There's no way to change the font or the font size on the editor.
- There's no way to change the colour scheme to light mode, I usually prefer to use that.
- When I zoom in, there's lots of free space beside the device display. Why is it not centered?

## Conclusion

We seem to have spent so much time making it easy for beginners, that we end up punishing and restricting the productivity of people that aren't beginners.
